%Running this script allows the user to open a GUI to help classify
%epilepsy data . 
%
% It is possible to train a new and costumizable classifier, or use
% classifiers that were already trained. The new classifier trained can be
% found on the workspace.
%
% It is also possible to use different data from other patients. Just be
% sure that the new patient file contains the variables Trg and FeatVectSel.
% The data will be processed by our program
%
% For more information please read on our report how to use the GUI
